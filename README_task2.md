## Next steps (Task 2 mapping)
For Task 2 (DML / Null handling), you can perform:
- Insert sample users, products, categories (some fields NULL or using DEFAULT).
- Update stock_qty after an order is placed.
- Delete a canceled order and demonstrate `ROLLBACK` in a transaction.
- Insert partial rows (e.g., address without address_line2) to show NULL handling.
- Show `INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...` by copying product rows for testing.
